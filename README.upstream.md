Outlook Assistant connects AI assistants to your Microsoft Outlook account through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Ask your AI assistant to search your inbox, send emails, schedule meetings, manage contacts, and configure mailbox settings — without leaving the conversation. Works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client.

**Works with personal Outlook.com and work/school Microsoft 365 accounts.**

### Why Outlook Assistant?

| Without Outlook Assistant | With Outlook Assistant |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Switch between your AI tool and Outlook to manage email | Read, search, send, and export emails directly from your AI assistant |
| Manually search and export email threads | Full email tools including search, threading, and bulk export |
| Context-switch for calendar and contacts | Manage calendar events, contacts, and settings in one place |
| Copy-paste email content into conversations | Your AI assistant reads your emails natively with full context |
| No programmatic access to mailbox rules or categories | Create inbox rules, manage categories, configure auto-replies |
| Manually check each email for phishing red flags | Forensic header analysis — DKIM, SPF, DMARC, spam scores, and delivery chain in one call |
| Poll your inbox to check for new mail | Delta sync returns only changes since your last check, with tokens for continuous polling |

## Features

| Module | Tools | What You Can Do |
|--------|------:|-----------------|
| **Email** | 8 | `search-emails` (list/search/delta/conversations), `read-email` (content + forensic headers), `send-email` (with dry-run + mail tips), `draft` (create/update/send/delete/reply/forward), `update-email` (read status, flags), `attachments`, `export`, `get-mail-tips` |
| **Calendar** | 3 | `list-events`, `create-event`, `manage-event` (update/decline/cancel/delete) |
| **Contacts** | 2 | `manage-contact` (list/search/get/create/update/delete), `search-people` |
| **Categories** | 3 | `manage-category` (CRUD), `apply-category`, `manage-focused-inbox` |
| **Settings** | 1 | `mailbox-settings` (get/set auto-replies/set working hours) |
| **Folder** | 1 | `folders` (list/create/move/stats/delete) |
| **Rules** | 1 | `manage-rules` (list/create/update/reorder/delete) |
| **Advanced** | 2 | `access-shared-mailbox`, `find-meeting-rooms` |
| **Auth** | 1 | `auth` (status/authenticate/about) |

**22 tools total** — consolidated from 55 for optimal AI performance. See the [Tools Reference](docs/quickrefs/tools-reference.md) for complete parameter details.

### Export Formats

Format support varies by `target`:

| Format | Extension | `target=message` (single) | `target=messages` (batch) | `target=conversation` (thread) |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| `mime` / `eml` | `.eml` | ✅ | – | ✅ |
| `mbox` | `.mbox` | – | – | ✅ |
| `markdown` | `.md` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `json` | `.json` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `html` | `.html` | – | – | ✅ |
| `csv` | `.csv` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Export individual emails, search results, or entire conversation threads — use `target=messages` with a search query (or the `query` shortcut) to batch-export without manually collecting IDs.

## Account Compatibility

Outlook Assistant works with both personal and work/school Microsoft accounts, but some features behave differently:

| Feature | Personal (Outlook.com) | Work/School (Microsoft 365) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Email read, send, search | Full support | Full support |
| Calendar events | Full support | Full support |
| Contacts CRUD | Full support | Full support |
| Inbox rules | Full support | Full support |
| Folders | Full support | Full support |
| Free-text `query` search | Limited — use `subject`, `from`, `to` filters instead | Full KQL support |
| Categories | Full support | Full support |
| Mailbox settings | Full support | Full support |
| Focused Inbox | API works (overrides stored) but mail routing not affected | Full support |
| Shared mailboxes | Not available | Requires `Mail.Read.Shared` |
| Meeting room search | Not available | Requires `Place.Read.All` + admin consent |

> **Note**: On personal accounts, Microsoft's `$search` API has limited support for free-text queries. Outlook Assistant handles this automatically with progressive search — if your query returns no results, it falls back through OData filters, boolean filters, and recent message listing to find your emails. For the most direct results on personal accounts, use the structured filter parameters (`from`, `subject`, `to`, `receivedAfter`).

### What Makes This Different

- **Progressive search** — on accounts where Microsoft's `$search` API is limited, Outlook Assistant automatically falls back through up to 4 search strategies to find your emails. Most Graph API wrappers fail silently; this one adapts.
- **Email forensics** — raw header access for DKIM, SPF, DMARC, delivery chain, X-Mailer, X-Originating-IP, and spam scores. Returns the full data so you can investigate phishing, audit compliance, or trace delivery issues. (Auto-verdict is on the v3.8.0 roadmap; today the data is surfaced and analysed in-conversation.)
- **Delta sync** — incremental inbox monitoring returns only what changed since your last check, with tokens for continuous polling. Designed for agent workflows that need to watch a mailbox.
- **Batch operations** — flag, move, export, or categorise multiple emails in a single call. Search-driven export lets you batch-export results without collecting IDs manually.
- **Pre-send intelligence** — check recipients for out-of-office, full mailbox, delivery restrictions, and moderation status before sending — no other Outlook MCP server offers this.
- **Compound automation** — rules, categories, folders, and Focused Inbox work together. Set up complete inbox management through your AI assistant in one conversation.

## Safety & Token Efficiency

Outlook Assistant is designed with safety-first principles for AI-driven email access:

**Destructive action safeguards** — Every tool carries [MCP annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#annotations) (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) so AI clients can auto-approve safe reads and prompt for confirmation on destructive operations like sending email or deleting events.

**Send-email protections** — The `send-email` tool includes:
- **Pre-send mail tips** (`checkRecipients: true`) — check recipients for out-of-office, mailbox full, delivery restrictions before sending
- **Dry-run mode** (`dryRun: true`) — preview composed emails without sending
- **Session rate limiting** — configurable via `OUTLOOK_MAX_EMAILS_PER_SESSION` (default: unlimited)
- **Recipient allowlist** — restrict sending to approved addresses/domains via `OUTLOOK_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS`

> **Recommended setup**: enable both safety belts in your `.mcp.json` from day one. They're off by default; `auth action=about` reports their state and prints a setup hint when unset. See [`.mcp.json.example`](.mcp.json.example) for a copy-paste template.
>
> ```json
> "env": {
>   "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID": "…",
>   "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET": "…",
>   "OUTLOOK_MAX_EMAILS_PER_SESSION": "10",
>   "OUTLOOK_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS": "your-domain.com,trusted@example.com"
> }
> ```

**Draft protections** — The `draft` tool shares `send-email` safety controls: dry-run preview, recipient allowlist, mail-tips validation, and rate limiting. The `send` action shares the `send-email` rate limit counter, preventing circumvention via the draft-then-send pathway.

**Token-optimised architecture** — Tools are consolidated using the STRAP (Single Tool, Resource, Action Pattern) approach. 22 tools instead of 55 reduces per-turn overhead by ~11,000 tokens (~64%), keeping more of the AI's context window available for your actual conversation. Fewer tools also means the AI selects the right tool more accurately — research shows tool selection degrades beyond ~40 tools.

> **Important**: These safeguards are defence-in-depth measures that reduce risk, but they are not a guarantee against unintended actions. AI-driven access to your email is inherently sensitive — always review tool calls before approving, particularly for sends and deletes. No automated guardrail is foolproof, and you remain responsible for actions taken through your mailbox.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g @littlebearapps/outlook-assistant
```

Or run directly without installing:

```bash
npx @littlebearapps/outlook-assistant
```

### 2. Register an Azure App

You need a Microsoft Azure app registration to authenticate. See the **[Azure Setup Guide](docs/guides/azure-setup.md)** for a detailed walkthrough (including first-time Azure account creation), or if you've done this before:

1. Create a new app registration at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Add Microsoft Graph delegated permissions (Mail, Calendar, Contacts)
3. Create a client secret and copy the **Value** (not the Secret ID)
4. Under Authentication > **Add a platform** > **Mobile and desktop applications** — check `nativeclient` URI
5. Enable **"Allow public client flows"** in Authentication > Advanced settings
6. _(Optional)_ Set redirect URI to `http://localhost:3333/auth/callback` — only needed for browser auth flow

### 3. Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your MCP client config:

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong> (<code>claude_desktop_config.json</code>)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@littlebearapps/outlook-assistant"],
      "env": {
        "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID": "your-application-client-id",
        "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret-VALUE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong> (CLI)</summary>

```bash
claude mcp add outlook -- npx @littlebearapps/outlook-assistant
```

Then set environment variables in your `.env` or shell.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong> (<code>.cursor/mcp.json</code>)</summary>

[![Install in Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Outlook%20Assistant&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyIteSIsIkBsaXR0bGViZWFyYXBwcy9vdXRsb29rLWFzc2lzdGFudCJdLCJlbnYiOnsiT1VUTE9PS19DTElFTlRfSUQiOiIiLCJPVVRMT09LX0NMSUVOVF9TRUNSRVQiOiIifX0=)

Or add manually to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@littlebearapps/outlook-assistant"],
      "env": {
        "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID": "your-application-client-id",
        "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret-VALUE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windsurf</strong> (<code>~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json</code>)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@littlebearapps/outlook-assistant"],
      "env": {
        "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID": "your-application-client-id",
        "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret-VALUE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### 4. Authenticate

1. Start the auth server: `outlook-assistant-auth` (or `npx @littlebearapps/outlook-assistant-auth`)
2. In your AI assistant, use the `auth` tool with `action=authenticate` to get an OAuth URL
3. Open the URL, sign in with your Microsoft account, and grant permissions
4. Tokens are saved locally and refresh automatically

> **Note**: The auth server needs `OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID` and `OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables. Your MCP client's `"env"` config only applies to the MCP server process — when running the auth server separately, ensure these are set in a `.env` file or exported in your shell.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm** (included with Node.js)
- **Azure account** for app registration ([free tier works](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/))

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @littlebearapps/outlook-assistant
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/littlebearapps/outlook-assistant.git
cd outlook-assistant
npm install
```

## Azure App Registration

> **First time with Azure?** The [Azure Setup Guide](docs/guides/azure-setup.md) covers everything from creating an account to your first authentication, including billing setup and common pitfalls.

### Create the App

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Sign in with a Microsoft Work or Personal account
3. Search for **App registrations** and click **New registration**
4. Enter a name (e.g. "Outlook Assistant Server")
5. Select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**
6. Set redirect URI: platform **Web**, URI `http://localhost:3333/auth/callback`
7. Click **Register**
8. Copy the **Application (client) ID**

### Add Permissions

1. Go to **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **Microsoft Graph** > **Delegated permissions**
2. Add these **required** permissions:
   - `offline_access` — refresh tokens between sessions
   - `User.Read` — basic profile
   - `Mail.Read`, `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Mail.Send` — email operations
   - `Calendars.Read`, `Calendars.ReadWrite` — calendar operations
   - `Contacts.Read`, `Contacts.ReadWrite` — contact management
   - `MailboxSettings.ReadWrite` — settings, auto-replies, categories
   - `People.Read` — people search
3. Optionally add **org-only** permissions (work/school accounts only):
   - `Mail.Read.Shared` — shared mailbox access
   - `Place.Read.All` — meeting room search (requires admin consent)
4. Click **Add permissions**

### Create a Client Secret

1. Go to **Certificates & secrets** > **New client secret**
2. Enter a description and select expiration
3. Click **Add**
4. **Copy the secret Value immediately** — you won't be able to see it again. Use the **Value**, not the Secret ID.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit with your Azure credentials:

```bash
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID=your-application-client-id
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-VALUE
USE_TEST_MODE=false
```

> **Note:** The server also accepts `MS_CLIENT_ID` and `MS_CLIENT_SECRET` for backwards compatibility.

**Optional overrides** (v3.8.0+) — see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list with commented worked examples:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OUTLOOK_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | OAuth audience: `common`, `consumers` (personal-only Azure apps), `organizations`, or single-tenant GUID. Fixes `AADSTS9002331` for personal-only app registrations. | `common` |
| `OUTLOOK_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` | IANA timezone applied to calendar events when callers don't pass one (e.g. `Europe/London`, `America/New_York`). | `Australia/Melbourne` |
| `OUTLOOK_MAX_EMAILS_PER_SESSION` | Cap on `send-email` + `draft send` per MCP server lifetime. | unlimited |
| `OUTLOOK_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS` | Comma-separated allowlist of domains/addresses for sends, drafts, and rule forwards. | unrestricted |

### MCP Client Configuration

See [Quick Start — Configure Your MCP Client](#3-configure-your-mcp-client) above for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf configs.

If installed from source, use `node` instead of `npx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/outlook-assistant/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID": "your-application-client-id",
        "OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret-VALUE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication Flow

### Device Code Flow (Default — Recommended)

No auth server needed. Works everywhere, including remote/headless environments.

1. Ask your AI assistant to authenticate (calls `auth` tool with `action=authenticate`)
2. Visit the URL shown (`microsoft.com/devicelogin`) on **any** browser, **any** device
3. Enter the code, sign in with your Microsoft account, and grant permissions
4. Tell your AI assistant to complete authentication (calls `auth` with `action=device-code-complete`)
5. Tokens are saved to `~/.outlook-assistant-tokens.json` and **refresh automatically**

> **Prerequisite**: Enable "Allow public client flows" in Azure Portal > your app > Authentication > Advanced settings.
>
> **Server restarts** (v3.7.2+): Device code state is persisted to `~/.outlook-assistant-pending-auth.json`, so `device-code-complete` works even if the MCP server restarts between steps 1 and 4 (e.g., Untether/Telegram bridge, Claude Desktop session changes).

### Browser Redirect Flow (Alternative)

For localhost development or if you prefer the traditional OAuth flow:

```bash
npm run auth-server
```

This starts a local server on port 3333 to handle the OAuth callback.

1. In your AI assistant, use the `auth` tool with `action=authenticate, method=browser`
2. Open the provided URL in your browser
3. Sign in and grant permissions — tokens are saved automatically

> **Note**: The auth server reads `OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID` and `OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` from environment variables. Your MCP client's `"env"` config only applies to the MCP server process, not a separately-started auth server.

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js'"

```bash
npm install
```

### "EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3333"

```bash
npx kill-port 3333
npm run auth-server
```

### "Invalid client secret" (AADSTS7000215)

You're using the Secret **ID** instead of the Secret **Value**. Go to Azure Portal > Certificates & secrets and copy the **Value** column.

### Authentication URL doesn't work

If using browser flow: start the auth server first with `npm run auth-server`. If using device code flow: visit `microsoft.com/devicelogin` instead.

### Device code "invalid_client"

Enable "Allow public client flows" in Azure Portal > App registrations > Authentication > Advanced settings.

### Token refresh fails after ~60 minutes (device code auth)

Fixed in v3.7.2. Earlier versions sent `client_secret` in token refresh requests for device-code auth, which Microsoft rejects for public client flows. Update to v3.7.2+ or re-authenticate.

### Empty API responses

Check authentication status with the `auth` tool (action=status). Tokens may have expired — re-authenticate if needed.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                     # Jest unit tests
npm run inspect              # MCP Inspector (interactive)
```

### Test Mode

Run with mock data (no real API calls):

```bash
USE_TEST_MODE=true npm start
```

### Extending the Server

1. Create a new module directory (e.g. `tasks/`)
2. Implement tool handlers in separate files
3. Export tool definitions from the module's `index.js`
4. Import and add tools to the `TOOLS` array in main `index.js`
5. Add tests in `test/`
6. Update `docs/quickrefs/tools-reference.md`

## Known Limitations

- **Personal account search**: Free-text `query` and `kqlQuery` rely on Microsoft's `$search` API, which has limited support on personal Outlook.com accounts. Outlook Assistant mitigates this with progressive search fallback (trying OData filters automatically), but for the most direct results, use structured filters (`from`, `subject`, `to`, `receivedAfter`).
- **Focused Inbox**: Only available on work/school Microsoft 365 accounts.
- **Shared mailboxes**: Require `Mail.Read.Shared` permission and a work/school account.
- **Meeting room search**: Requires `Place.Read.All` permission with admin consent (work/school accounts only).
- **Export default path**: Exports save to the system temp directory by default. Use `savePath` or `outputDir` to specify a different location.
